this command can be a bit tricky. lets break it down.

!dashboard: this is the main command and will come before anything else.
    >pfp: this subcommand edits the profile pictures size and position. it requires three arguements (x, y, size) default: (650, 50, 300)
    >box_color: this subcommand edits the text boxes color and opacity, it requires 4 arguements (red,green,blue,opacity)
    >nickname: this changes your display name.
    >bio: this updates your bio. keep it short, there is limited space.
examples:
    !dashboard pfp 650 50 300
    !dashboard box_color 0 125 255 170
    !dashboard nickname i am the best
    !dashboard bio imagine all the possibilities. with all the great minds out there im sure great bio\'s will show up.
patches coming soon for the skids who cant follow simple examples lol.
