Welcome to the Fantasy Auction House Bot! With this opportunity, I strive to provide a unique, fun, and engaging way to kill time on kik. Soon, I shall offer a plethora of minigames, such as the mining minigame, which allows you to gather ores and materials to create items. 

Features:
1. Auction Listings: List items for auction and bid on items others list.
2. Inventory Management: View and manage your inventory of items.
3. Currency Management: Earn and spend currency to participate in auctions.
4. User Titles: Earn notable titles based on your activity and achievements.
5. Item Categories: Explore various fantasy items, including weapons, armor, and potions.
6. Auction Events: Participate in special events and auctions with unique items
7. minigames: collect increasingly rare ores, gems, and other materials to create items you can use in RP or sell in the auction house.

The auction house is a 90% user-based project, which means. Every material was generated by a user, and every item was crafted in roleplay by a user with one of the craftsmen's titles. I'm proud to say that the auction is lore first and mechanics second; any items you could imagine can be created and may continue to bring excitement to the other user...... so long as you have the gold to make it happen, that is.
